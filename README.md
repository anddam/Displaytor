* Displaytor

A small utility to get the size of a display given its diagonal and
ratio between width and height.

It converts between inches, the most common measure unit used by
manufacturers when giving specs about their products, and centimeters,
the measure unit needed when you want to give some sense to specs.

* License

It is customary to specific some form of open license when distributing code
but since so far I never cared to understand the differences among those
let's say this program has a permissive license. 

Do whatever you want with it but you're not allowed to harm people,
electronic devices nor small mammals with it.
